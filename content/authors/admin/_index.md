At present, I have the privilege of being a visiting student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign under the esteemed guidance of Professor [Huan Zhang](https://huan-zhang.com/). I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Mingjie Tang (SCU)](https://merlintang.github.io/) and to work with [Prof.Carl Yang (Emory)](http://www.cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/) to bring me to the research world. I am a highly motivated and passionate undergraduate eagerly seeking admission to a Ph.D. program beginning at 2025 Fall.

My research interest lies at Trustworthy Machine Learning. Specifically, I focus on enhancing the trustworthiness of ML-driven applications and related topics around foundation models and ML algorithms.
