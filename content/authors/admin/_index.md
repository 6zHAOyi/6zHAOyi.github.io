I am a first year Ph.D. student at University of Maryland, College Park (UMD). I have the privilege of being advised by Prof. Ang Li. Before beginning my journey at UMD, I completed my undergraduate studies at SCU, where I had a valuable opportunity to work under the guidance of Prof. Mingjie Tang. I am also glad to have the chance as a visiting student at University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign under the guidance of Prof. Huan Zhang.

My research interests lie in advancing the frontiers of foundation models.
